        <h2 class="sub-heading">  HAPPY 17TH MONTHSARY MYBEAUTIFUL COQUETTE BEBUU LATTE HEHWHEHWHEH I LOVE YOU SO MUCH AND FOREVER MY ONLY LATTE  </h2>
        <p class="love-letter">
            
            
            
            I don't know if this is valid excuse but since we're living in a technology era i think its safe to say that
            i can finally create my own love letters here on your own webpage that i created for you my beautiful bebu latte ðŸ¥ºðŸŽ€ <br>
            <br>
            i also don't know if i created this because i'm too lazy to create letters or because i wanted to try something new with you my bebu ko
            there's so many things i wanted to learn about me, the world, and especially to you my bebu latte :3 <br>
            <br>
            I tried my best to create the most appealing design to symbolize your favorite colors which is  pink ðŸ’—, green ðŸ’š, and brown ðŸ¤Ž
            and your favorite sticker which is latte ðŸ¥º<br>
            <br>
            I also began to reconnect with my emotions and feelings that were onced brushed off due to the light that burnt me out on my mid grade 11 days, 
            i thought I weren't going to be the same person after a couple of months coping from my responsibilities due to the confusion i felt 
            when i finally found that i onced believed my purpose. and yea maybe leading people and helping them weren't a mission 
            to be filled out for someone like me who couldn't even help himself out due to the existensial crisis that i am going through 
            those days. I lost myself, my so called friends, and my purpose, but you. you didn't left me at all. The light you shared
            with me was the only thing that keeps me awake for days when i wanted to sleep and never wake up again.<br>
            <br>
            you are the one who made me felt that i wasn't alone, that i am not a burden to anyone, and that i am worthy of love and care of someone like you
            and i never thought that out of 12 billion people on this planet, i would find someone so bright like you that  woke me up from the grave 
            that i believed that will be my place for my entire life. <br>
            <br>
            you did the things that allowed me to move forward to seek that light again, but this time with someone who is willing to walk with me 
            and guide me to the right path. and that journey wasn't easy at all. I thought that after all of that and all mistakes that i did 
            you were going to be the one that will leave me and permnently close the door that i once opened for you.
            but you didn't. you stayed with me and even opened the door wider for me to walk through it. to doscover more things about love that
            i never thought was real. you allowed me to feel things that i never felt before and make me feel more human that i has ever been.
            the connection that we have is something special that needs to be kept alive forever. Our bond to each other will be the one to form that light again
             to guide us through it all and i believe that all of our plans in the future will be possible. and yes i know it would't be easy for us
             but in this time I believe that we will do this forever while holding our hands tight together. <br>
             <br>
             You are the most special person that made me feel this way about the conection and intimacy of two human beings you are my guiding Light
             and i couldn't ask for more but to stay with me forever because there are no other us. And that what makes us special.
             you are the most special part of my life that fills the emptiness of my heart and as a person who is still learning to love and to be loved,
             I really wish and hope that both of us will make it. because you are all I need and i won't let down of what we have. 
             we'll play and minecraft and roblox together and explore each other's world while we are growing up in this world.

             I love you forever my beautiful coquette bebu latte this webpage is dedicated only for you baby ko :3 <br>
